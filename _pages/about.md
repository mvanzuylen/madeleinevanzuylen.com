Welcome! My name is Mady, and I'm a Master's student in CS at Northeastern University based out of Seattle, WA. I previously worked at the [Allen Institute for AI (AI2)](https://allenai.org/) as a Data Science Analyst on the [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/about) team. 

As an undergrad, I studied Biochemistry and Computational Math & Stats at Notre Dame and interned in the[Fields lab](http://www.fieldslab.org/) at UW, and the [Brenner Lab](https://brennergroup.seas.harvard.edu/) and [Weitz Lab](https://weitzlab.seas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University.
